Started late but whatever.

I'm marking this project as complete. Moving on to some other project, I'm thinking a chat app. Can't wait to take [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette) out for a spin.

Things I'd have liked to build into this but won't be doing:
+ Redics caching
+ Time-limited clipboards (deleting after 8 hours).
+ Comprehensive tests to run for CI/CD when deploying (wrote some on Postman though)
+ Optimization.. making the main app as snappy as possible.

Oh well.
